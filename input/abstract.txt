We search for the resonant production of a new massive scalar X decaying into a new lighter scalar Y and the standard model Higgs boson H through the process $X \rightarrow YH \rightarrow b\bar{b} b\bar{b}$. The search uses proton-proton collision data from the CERN LHC, collected at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV in 2016--2018 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 $fb^{-1}$. The search is performed in mass ranges of X (0.9--4 TeV) and Y (60--600 GeV) where both the Y and the H are highly Lorentz-boosted and therefore their b quark-antiquark daughter particles are sufficiently collimated to be reconstructed using single large-area jets each. Upper limits are placed on the production cross section as a function of the masses of X and Y. The results are interpreted in the context of scalar resonances predicted in the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model and in the more general extension of the standard model with two additional scalar fields. This search significantly extends the constraints on the models under consideration.
